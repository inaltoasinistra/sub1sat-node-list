# sub1sat-node-list
This is a **community-driven, experimental approach** to catalog Bitcoin nodes (economic and mining) that accept **sub 1 sat/vByte transactions**, including sub-dust or zero-fee transactions.   It aims to support research, propagation, and testing of low-fee Bitcoin transactions across the network.
